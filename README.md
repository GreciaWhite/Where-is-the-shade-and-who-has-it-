Creating interactive maps with R using U.S. Census data by tract level from the Annual American Survey to measure median income and ages of those 60 years and older who use public transportation to get to work in Austin, Texas. We also use Capital Metro data to map out the bus stops that have a shade structure and those without any shade structure. We also use City of Austin Tree Canopy Map to map percentages of tree canopy cover across neighborhoods in Austin. This all helps us explore the topic of shade as it relates to public transit in the city of Austin, Texas.
